It's too late to do much other than contain the speed of the spread.  Leaders should stop dithering and suspend all trading on the stock market.  They should require mortgage companies and banks to freeze mortgage and loan repayment requirements for the next two-three months.  Doesn't mean they don't get the money, but they get it later, Then everybody could breathe for a bit.
