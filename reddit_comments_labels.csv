1,"I am genuinely concerned in regards to an event taking place in Philadelphia this weekend that could cause a larger outbreak in the area. The event goes by the name of Erin Express. Long story short, every St. Patrick's day weekend they provide buses for patrons of a bar crawl (which number in the thousands) and travel them throughout the city to partake in the festivities. Even though every major gathering has been cancelled they are doubling down on their efforts. I have reached out to the mayor and have yet to receive any response. What can I do to cancel this event?

The mayors name is Mr. James Kenny, if you could please e-mail him asking for this request it would go a long way. james.kenney@phila.gov

I have no where else to turn but here. Please help me In Contacting the mayor to cancel this event.

Edit: For anyone saying they can not refund money... this event is FREE for all patrons and NO BARS charge a cover.",1

I do live in italy, we are now shut down by the government.

No one is allowed to go outside unless it is for serious work or health reasons.

my dad is a nurse and they really have too choose whom to save and whom to let die.

People are in panic and supermarkets are empty of food.

All the public places are closed, so no parks, gyms, offices, bars and even schools are open. outside the few people you find are afraid of standing near eachother and not even between family we stay phisically closed.

An entire nation is spending but not earning since a week ago, and it will be so till 5th of April atleast.

Life is weird and it feels very weird and scary living in this situation. I'll keep you posted.

My husband is a retail pharmacist and started feeling ill last night with flu-like symptoms.

We called our local public health department and an urgent care that was still open to see what they recommended.

Here's what we were told about getting COVID-19 tested since tests are in such short supply:

1)  To be considered for the test, you must be having severe/critical possibly life-threatening flu-like symptoms.

And that if you were having such symptoms, you would need to go straight to the ER.

That itself is a $500 or more bill...and that isn't even testing yet.

2)  You must have been around someone confirmed to have COVID-19 or traveled out of the country.

3)  They will likely want to test you for the flu first and that test was done at an urgent care last night for a visit totalling $75.

#How are we encouraging testing and protecting people financially when they will likely have to pay $75 for an urgent care visit or $500+ for an ER visit?",1
43,"I've been in Taipei since before the first cases were identified. The Taiwanese government moved very, very fast on this, before there was even a name for the ""mystery flu"" that might be related to SARS. When China told the world ""We're confident that human to human transmission is impossible"", and the WHO chided Taiwan for enacting early travel restrictions.

School closures happened almost immediately, as well as subsidies for affected businesses, temperature checks in public places, and screenings at airports. People who did not report symptoms voluntarily were fined $10,000, and quarantines were set up for those entering the country with any symptoms, until they could be tested.

Taiwan also developed their own test kits domestically, and quickly developed a set of treatment protocols based on early reports of success in halting symptoms with antivirals. (It also helps that everyone has public access to health care and isn't afraid of being bankrupted by a hospital visit).

The Taxi driver who passed away in Taiwan was the fifth person outside China to die from the virus. He was slow to report his symptoms because there had not yet been a case of local transmission in Taiwan, and he drove an unlicensed taxi that catered toward mostly Chinese tourists. He also had pre-existing health conditions which may have hastened the onset of his more severe symptoms.

When he and his wife tested positive, the government gathered a list of everyone they had come in to contact with, who were notified and tested.

When Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers were identified in February as testing positive for Coronavirus, the Taiwanese government created a tracking map of all of the places cruise ship passengers frequently visit in Taipei and the surrounding areas, along with a timeline of the 8 hour period Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers had visited Taipei, on January 31st. They then sent out mass cell phone notifications through the entire region to share the maps, timelines, and instructions for those who visited affected areas and should be tested.

In early January, Taiwan proactively banned the export of surgical masks, to prevent supplies from running out. Government officials instituted immediate limitations on the purchase of masks, and created a registration / rationing system, before shortages occurred. Only designated retailers could sell masks, at a cost of 15¢ each. Additionally, they imported 60 machines to increase government-funded production of masks, and have recently increased output by an additional 10 million masks per day.

It's amazing how proactive and fast the government response has been. It should be held up as a model for countries not yet affected by the Coronavirus.",1

81,"&#x200B;

I am a 29 yrs old in Bologna.

Cannot leave the house for anything but basic necessities which include basically exclusively buying food at the closest supermarket ( where they form a queue to let people in just a few at the time ) . I cannot visit family, or friends. I cannot go to non food shops ( all closed), a bar(all closed) or anywhere at all really. Several councils have also blocked access to public parks . I cannot go to have a walk without being handed a fine of 200 euros. I cannot have people over, nor meet them in any place, public or private.

My job ( live events) is completely in standstill because of the lockdown, and my company and the surrounding industry have been almost definitely harmed beyond repair. I have no stable income because of the lockdown, and cannot see my family, my girlfriend or any of my friends. I share an apartment with two friends (sooo lucky) which means I only have them as company. I am fucking scared. I wonder if I'll have to change career, or if my parents will be alright, and what kind of country will be left for me when this ends, which by all estimates is going to be in a few months. I am not a scientist, but looking at the numbers in wuhan it looks we are still at the base of the exponential, and conditions will worsen sensibly before they get better.

I think this is a momentous time, this is probably going to change the society I live in, and the world. I am not just talking about the economic damage, the cancelled olympics, the cancelled nba season ( I am an nab fan, and so sad to not be able to take advantage of my free time with some games). I am talking about the social effect of taking a world already starved of Real social interactions, and locking it up for months with minimal access to art, love, touch, sex, family, friends. What will this do to us? as I think many in the world are going to face the same fate as me, from China to the US to France and Spain, I would like to start a conversation about where we are, how we are doing, and how to digest this traumatic condition of shock I feel in. I used to organise parties, concerts, and festivals. All of our investments for months to come is lost, the work of years thrown in the toilet and leaving us with nothing but debts. Weeks ago I was partying with friends in Rome, attending concerts, planning a wonderful summer of touring ( I also play in a band, which had the whole tour cancelled) . The financial loss, the damage is incalculable.

I have a condition which requires me to attend the ER through some periods of the year, as it is a seasonal thing. I am scared this will come now, as hospitals might be dangerous and\\or filled to the brim.

I miss people, so if you are in the same place as me, please let me know how you are doing.",1
